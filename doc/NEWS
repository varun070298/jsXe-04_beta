04/25/2006  version 0.4 beta

    * Updated to work with xerces 2.8.0 (jsXe now requires xerces 2.8.0)
    * Updated support for different encodings. Now jsXe will support all
      encodings that the JVM being used supports. jsXe now opens documents
      properly by examining the files for UTF file markers or the encoding
      in the XML declaration. jsXe will now save files properly and write
      the correct encoding in the xml declaration.
    * Added built-in completion and introspection support for XML Schema, XHTML,
      XSLT, and XSL:FO
    * Added a null menu item to the recent files menu for when there are
      no recent files in the list.
    * Added an option to allow the user to specify the line separator.
    * Made some GUI tweaks to the splash screen.
    * Made some tweaks to how the serializer formats XML Documents

02/19/2006  version 0.4 pre3

    * Added Activity Log menu option to the Help menu
    * Added splash screen for jsXE startup
    * Added support for caching external files to the disk in the user's
      settings directory. This should make load times faster for files with a
      lot of external files that are downloaded. jsXe now requires the commons
      xml-commons resolver jar file.
    * Added a dialog that shows a document's validation errors.
    * The open file dialog now defaults to the directory specified in
      the system parameter user.dir. This causes tho open file dialog to open
      to the C:\Documents and Settings\user directory instead of the My
      Documents directory in windows. This makes the open file dialogs
      consistent.
    * jsXe now allows plugins to specify their own localized messages. These
      messages are stored in properties files in the plugin jar file under the
      'messages' directory. The files are named identically to jsXe's messages
      files (messages.en, messages.de).
    * Added support for detecting a file's line separator and preserving it for
      later during write. This preserves the correct line separator for a file.
      This will added as an option later.
    * Fixed a bug allow jsXe to parse documents that have multi-byte characters.
    * Removed feature that when you type something it begins editing the
      current node in the tree view. It would begin editing even if you typed
      menu shortcut.
    * Added a feature to add Document Type nodes. This is pretty basic but it
      allows you to add new DOCTYPE nodes to the tree.
    * Added cut/copy/paste support for nodes in the tree view. There are still
      some limitations like the keyboard shortcuts don't work, and the actions
      don't work when focused on the right hand side pane.
    * Added support for smart HOME/END in the source view. HOME and END will now
      take you to the first/last non-whitespace characters.
    * Fixed some syntax highlighting problems with DTDs that have internal
      subsets.
    * Added end of line markers and and option to turn them on or off.
    * Added support for maintaining indent when adding new lines

07/01/2005  version 0.4 pre2

    * Added Swedish translation thanks to Patrik Johansson
    * Added German translation thanks to Bianca Schoen
    * Better internationalization support
    * Added a new option that allows you to show all attributes, just ID
      attributes or no attributes in the tree.
    * Added a new dialog when to allow a user to more easily save and discard
      files when closing multiple dirty files. This is shown when exiting
      jsXe or using the close-all action.
    * Added support for showing choosing attribute values defined in the
      Schema/DTD in the Attributes table.
    * Fixed word wrapping in the right hand pane of the tree view
    * Added syntax highlighting support in the source view
        * You can set the colors used for syntax highlighting in the source
          view options pane in the global options.
    * Added a context menu to the source view. This allows you to execute the
      actions in the edit menu from a right-click menu.
      
    * Fixed bug where user specific properties were being overwritten by
      a plugin's default properties
    * Added a check for the correct Xerces version.
    * Added tooltip texts for the checkboxes/scroll panes of the Options dialog
      box.
    * Fixed bug that didn't mark the file as dirty when changing the indent
      and formatting and soft indent were true.


05/08/2005  version 0.4 pre1

    * Added new support for validation
        * Added support allowing allowed tag names to be derived from
          DTD/Schema. Users can create a new node this way through a dialog
          that knows the users
    * Fixed several namespace bugs having to do with editing nodes with
      namespaces
    * Added support for adding entity reference nodes to the document.
    * Added some support for internationalization. Some messages can be
      overridden in the user's native language.
    * Fixed a bug where the recent files menu would include a file twice.
    * Fixed a bug where jsXe thought the document is not well formed if the
      DTD/Schema could not be found. It is treated as a validation error.
    * Fixed various other bugs.
    
03/30/2005  verison 0.3 beta

    * Added much better namespace support. Users can no longer create
      non-wellformed documents by changing namespaces.
        * Users can no longer remove namespace declarations when there are
          attributes that use it.
    * Added a command line option to enable printing debug to the command line.

03/09/2005  version 0.3 pre15

    * Added plugin support. Now additional views can be added to jsXe easily
      without recompiling. Plugins can set dependencies. If the plugin requires
      a certain version of java, jsXe, or another plugin it can be specified
      by the plugin writer.
    * Added a plugin manager dialog to show information about loaded plugins.
    * Fixed bug in the find and replace dialog that caused a null pointer
      exception.
    * Added an 'Ignore Case' Check box to the find dialog
    
11/23/2004  version 0.2 beta

    * Fixed bug that didn't update the tab width for the source view when
      you changed it in the options
    * Fixed bugs where the menu bar wasn't updated properly when closing files
      and changing views
    * Fixed a bug that kept files open too long by not closing the Reader
      object used to read them.
    * Changed the layout of the options dialog by taking some jEdit code.
      Should be more flexable for adding different options categories etc. Not
      to mention that it would look better.
    * Documents opened directly into the source view are no longer formatted
      automatically when the format-pretty-print property is true. This
      prevents loading documents where whitespace is matters without marking
      them dirty.
    * The serializer now ignores the element-content-whitespace parameter since
      the parameter only makes sense when the document is validated by DTD or
      Schema that specifies that an element MUST have only child elements
      (element-content). Also if the DOM validates this info when being edited
      then the serializer could never write out whitespace in element content
      without invalidating the document. See
      http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/javadocs/dom3-api/index.html Section 2.10
    * Removed the whitespace in element content checkbox from the options since
      it's ignored
    * Removed the show whitespace only nodes check box since showing
      whitespace only nodes in conjunction with formatting options makes
      synchronization between options and the document difficult.

8/19/2004   version 0.2 pre20   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused a document to be loaded dirty because the fact
      that it was dirty was saved to the recent files list
    * The Move No Drop cursor is now displayed when dragging a node over a
      drop target that rejects it.
    * The SourceView search and replace dialog now closes if you change views.
      The sourceview also reuses the dialog if it's open already when you hit
      the find menu item.
    * Fixed a bug that caused jsXe to not allow you to open documents that
      were not well formed.
    * Implemented the soft-tabs feature in the source view.
    * Added a very preliminary search and replace dialog to the source view.
      jsXe now requires the gnu.regexp package

07/24/2004  version 0.2 pre12

    * Added support for a recent files list that can allow users to open
      files they have recently used.
    * Added an option to allow the user to specify the number of recent files
      that jsXe remembers
    * When jsXe opens a file now it checks if it's in the recent files list
      and opens it with the remembered properties automatically
    * Fixed problem where the node did not appear to be selected after drag and
      drop but was. Needed to add the node to the selection model.
    * Fixed a bug that caused the right hand text pane to clear when trying to
      edit using it. When dragging and dropping a node the node stays selected
      but is not highlighted however. This may be confusing to users.
    * Fixed a bug that causing jsXe to not update the title properly when a
      document was closed.

06/12/2004  version 0.2 pre6

    * Fixed a bug that caused non-dirty, non-untitled document to save when
      they were closed.
    * Added code for autoscrolling when doing drag and drop using the Autoscroll
      interface and fuctionality.
    * Added logic to expand tree nodes when you hover over them for a period of
      time.
    * Tooltip for processing instructions is now correct.
    * Added a new Reload action to the file menu so that users can reload the
      current document from disk
    * Allowed users to add a comment node to the document root.
    * fixed a bug that caused a processing instruction to not be printed on a
      new line when serialized.
    * Fixed a bug that caused ArrayOutOfBounds exceptions to be thrown
      sometimes when adding nodes via the JTree in DefaultView

06/12/2004  version 0.1 beta

    * Did some testing and fixed some miscellaneous bugs.
    * changed version naming scheme. Development versions are now the next
      major.minor version with a preXX at the end (eg. 0.2 pre75). Mostly done
      so it's easier to put the version in the build file and have it make
      sense for beta/stable releases.

05/16/2004  version 0.1.75
    
    * Added code to remember the expanded states of nodes after they are
      dragged and dropped into other nodes
    * Added xsd files to the file filters when opening a document.
    * Updated how the splitpane locations are set up. The look better now and
      and set themselves to a percentage of the window size as a starting
      value.
    * Updated the DOMSerializer to implement the newest version
      of the LSSerializer interface. jsXe requires Xerces 2.6.2.
    * Fixed a bug in the serializer that caused the root element opening tag
      to be placed directly after a document type definition.
    * Fixed a bug in serialization that caused only the public id and not
      the system id to be seraliazed if both existed in a doctype node.
    * Fixed a bug that was causing comment nodes to indented too far
      when formatting the document during serialization.
    * When dragging and dropping and/or adding nodes the nodes that whose
      locations have changed are always visible after the change.
    * Added a Close All action to the file menu so that users can close all of
      the open xml documents at once.
    * Made it so that external dtds are not loaded since jsXe can't do anything
      with them anyway.
    * Implemented support for split-cdata-sections in the DOMSerializer. CDATA
      nodes are now split when serializing so that they are valid when saved.
    * Fixed bug where jsxe generated NumberFormatExceptions if user defined
      saved properties were incorrectly formatted.
    * Made it so that element nodes can't be edited in the JTree unless
      you select 'Rename Node' from the context menu. This is done because of
      some problems with compatiblity between the editing and drag and drop.
    * Made split panes in the default tree view one touch expandable.
    * Made it so if opening a file and the only document open is untitled
      and clean then jsXe closes it.
    * Added key mnemonics to the menu bar items so that you can navigate them
      easier using the keyboard.

04/17/2004  version 0.1.64

    * Updated Drag and Drop to look nicer.
    * When you save out of the options panel after you changed options that
      change the XML document itself the open document is marked as dirty.
    * Fixed a bug where the source was not being changed when the encoding
      was changed because the XMLDocument object thought that the source
      was synced with the DOM.
    * Added the ability to rearrange text nodes and other nodes that aren't
      elements around within an element in the tree view. The location where
      the node will be dropped in the tree is highlighted.
    * Added support for checking the version and getting command-line help
      for jsXe via command-line options
    * Fixed a bug that didn't allow users to open a document if the DTD couldn't
      be found. Still won't think it's well formed though.
    * Fixed a couple bugs that caused null pointer exceptions when inserting
      around the document root.
    * Added logic to the tree in the Default view so that dragged and dropped
      nodes are always visible after a drop. New nodes that are added
      through the context menu are also visible after they are added.

03/18/2004  version 0.1.57

    * jsXe now requires xerces 2.6.0. No other xerces release will work with
      jsXe at this time.
    * Fixed a bug where the html pane was editable after opening a new document
      though no node was selected.
    * Added a "Rename Node" action to the default view tree's context menu. You
      can still rename it by clicking twice (not double clicking) on the element
      node.
    * Fixed a bug in the attributes table where it wasn't updated properly.
      It now updates properly and sorts based on the order in which they will
      be serialized (alphabetical).
    * Changed tabs to use icons instead of appending a '*' to the tab name to
      indicate a file is dirty.
    * jsXe now asks you if you really want to overwrite existing files on disk.
    * Nodes in the default view tree are now rendered as different icons for
      different node types. (Note: used icons from XML plugin for jEdit)
    * Added support for writing the internal part of a DOCTYPE to the XML
      document when saving and using source view.
    * DOCTYPE nodes are no longer visible in the tree. Some other method for
      editing doc types will have to be added to jsXe later.
    * Added preliminary drag n drop support for the tree in the default view.
      You can now drag nodes from one parent to another in the tree view. You
      can also drag a node to any thing that accepts text from a drag n drop
      operation.

11/23/2003  version 0.1.43

    * jsXe can now open more than one file at a time.
    * jsXe can now open and save files that are not well-formed.
    * Fixed bug where jsXe would only open the first file given several files
      on the command line.
    * Fixed bug where the * dirty file indicator was going away when switching
      views.
    * Fixed a bug where a document was marked dirty when switching views.
    * Fixed problem where the tree in the default view allowed you to select
      multiple nodes and cause undesired operation.

10/30/2003  version 0.1.39

    * Added support for dirty files. When you make changes to a document
      it is marked dirty and has an '*' in the tab name. jsXe also asks you
      if you want to save if you have dirty documents open.
    * Fixed a bug that caused an error message and undesired behavior when
      removing nodes.
    * Fixed many miscellaneous bugs.

10/23/2003  version 0.1.37

    * Fixed the problem with jsXe not finding DTD documents and other external
      entities.
    * jsXe now updates the interface more after you change a document's options.
    * Fixed the problem with the tree view collapsing after adding new nodes
      or changing some nodes.
    * Fixed a bug that caused problems when saving as a file that was already
      open. This was fixed earlier but the bug was reintroduced somewhere.
    * Changed to a new version system where the build version is updated
      automatically. This means the build version will get higher faster.
    * Fixed some other bugs.

08/31/2003  version 0.1.13

    * Fixed another nasty bug with createElement() creating elements with a
      null local name when element nodes are renamed. Used createElementNS()
      instead.
    * Fixed performance issues with opening files (that weren't even that
      large.)

08/30/2003  version 0.1.12

    * Fixed a very nasty bug that caused jsXe to save blank files.

08/30/2003  version 0.1.11
    
    * jsXe has some more options. The options are specific to each open XML
      Document. These include the an encoding drop down box and the ability to
      format XML output.

    * Several enhancements have been made to serialization of XML documents.
      This allows for better looking and more flexable saved documents and
      source.

    * Fixed a bug that caused uncaught exceptions when saving a file as an
      already open file.

    * Fixed a bug when writing files that causes characters like < > ' to not
      be written properly.

07/09/2003  version 0.1.1

    * Initial Release. Simple functions are implemented for tree view, add
      element and text nodes, remove nodes etc. Source view is a normal text
      area with which you can edit the source of the XML document.
