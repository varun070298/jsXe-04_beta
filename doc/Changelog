04/18/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made some GUI tweaks to the splash screen.
    * Made some tweaks to how the serializer formats XML Documents
    * Fixed bug 1467968: Splitting CDATA tags doesn't work

04/08/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated support for different encodings. Now jsXe will support all
      encodings that the JVM being used supports. jsXe now opens documents
      properly by examining the files for UTF file markers or the encoding
      in the XML declaration. jsXe will now save files properly and write
      the correct encoding in the xml declaration.
    * Added built-in completion support for XML Schema, XHTML, XSLT, and XSL:FO

04/07/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added a null menu item to the recent files menu for when there are
      no recent files in the list.
    * Added an option to allow the user to specify the line separator.

03/16/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added a URI to the XMLDocument class to allow the XMLDocument to know
      where the document is located.
    * Added some framework for support introspection for built in document
      types.

02/06/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated to work with xerces 2.8.0

02/19/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Released 0.4 pre3
    * Fixed bug 143401802. BufferHistory now builds a dom and writes it out
      using DOMSerializer which ensures that the document will be well-formed
      and that special characters will be written out properly.
    * Fixed bug 1434017. The dirty files dialog wasn't closing the dialog
      properly when you save all the files.

02/17/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug where indeces weren't being kept properly when serializing a
      document that was larger than the write buffer size.

02/16/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in AdapterNode that allowed you to remove the root document
      element node.
    * Added a copy method to AdapterNode to facilitate copying nodes during
      document editing.

02/10/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made a fix to XMLDocument to allow it to parse documents that
      have multi-byte characters. The current implementation of the
      ContentManagerInputStream is inadequate to deal with multi-byte
      characters. The solution is to extract the document as a string and
      parse it using a StringReader. This is a bit inefficient as the whole
      document has to be copied into a String object but it will probably be
      adequate for at least the immediate future since jsXe doesn't deal
      _really_ well with large files anyway.

02/09/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Disabled removing document type nodes
    * Whenever requesting validation errors from an XMLDocument the document
      will now check the validity of the document regardless of whether the
      document itself has been changed because the DTD or Schema it is
      validated againtst may have changed (e.g. in another open tab in jsXe).

02/03/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for detecting a file's line separator and preserving it for
      later during write.

02/02/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * jsXe now allows plugins to specify their own localized messages. These
      messages are stored in properties files in the plugin jar file under the
      'messages' directory. The files are named identically to jsXe's messages
      files (messages.en, messages.de).

01/30/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * jsXe now shows the correct validation errors in the validation errors
      dialog box.

01/19/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed how external schema files are resolved.

11/21/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a number of bugs having to do with how and when the XML document
      is parsed.

11/09/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * The open file dialog now defaults to the directory specified in
      the system parameter user.dir. This causes tho open file dialog to open
      to the C:\Documents and Settings\user directory instead of the My
      Documents directory in windows.

11/01/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * XMLDocuments were marked as not synced with the document after they
      were parsed in some cases. This caused the document to serialize itself
      it some unnessary places and sometimes mark itself as dirty because of it.
    * Fixed a bug where the Log file stream was being closed by the
      ActivityLogDialog.
    * Added a dialog that shows validation errors (though this may not be
      working quite yet, I'm not sure I'm setting the parameters with Xerces
      correctly).
    * Fixed validation so that it returns correct error messages.

10/26/2005 Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in the caching process that caused fatal IOExceptions to be
      thrown.

10/25/2005 Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated the about dialog to get it's messages in a locale specific way.
      Now the about dialog can be displayed in other languages.
    * Added support for caching external files to the disk in the user's
      settings directory. This should make load times faster for files with a
      lot of external files. jsXe now requires the commons xml-commons resolver
      jar file.

10/24/2005 Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated how the splash screen gets updated on startup to make it
      more active.
    * Updated the activity log dialog to display the label as well as
      the close/ok button better. Fixed the loading and saving of the geometry.
      Added a default size to the default properties so that it doesn't
      have a tiny size the first time it's opened.

07/12/2005 Trish Hartnett <trishah136@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Updated javadoc for ProgresSplashScreenWindow
	
07/09/2005 Trish Hartnett <trishah136@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added splash screen for jsXE startup
	* Changed format of Activity Log Dialog so that buttons were arranged neater.

07/02/2005  Trish Hartnett <trishah136@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added Activity Log menu option to the Help menu
	* Edited jsXe so that when the DirtyFilesDialog appears, it's sized correctly

07/01/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Released version 0.4pre2

06/29/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made some changes suggested by FindBugs.

06/28/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Modified the DirtyFilesDialog to make it look a little bit better.
        * Changed to use the BorderLayout better
        * Changed to allow the JList to size itself correctly
        * Changed from using 3 JPanels to using 1 and using the BorderLayout to
          arrange the components
        * Changed from using a JPanel to format the buttons to using a Box which
          arranges the buttons closer to the way you want.
    * Dirty files dialog doesn't show if there is only one dirty file.
    * If you select all files in the dirty files dialog then choose save
      selected and then cancel any save the dialog will no longer close. It will
      remain open to prompt with what to do with the files you cancelled.
    * Added some tooltip messages to the jsXe options menu and XML Document
      options menu.
    
06/27/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Removed some NOTICES to the log in the DirtyFilesDialog since they aren't
      necessary.
    * Added some new NOTICEs to the Log

06/21/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated jsXe so that it uses the DirtyFilesDialog when selecting
      'Close All' from the File menu.
    * Updated the DirtyFilesDialog so that it doesn't close until all files are
      either saved or discarded.
    * Updated DirtyFilesDialog so that it saves it's geometry to the properties
      properly.
    * Updated jsXe so that recent files information is saved even when closing
      files through the DirtyFilesDialog

06/20/2005  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added Bianca Schoen to the about dialog for her contribution of a German
      translation.
    * Fixed bug that didn't mark the file as dirty when changing the indent
      and formatting and soft indent were true.

06/15/2005 Trish Hartnett <trishah136@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added tooltip texts for the checkboxes/scroll panes of the Options dialog box.

06/13/2005 Trish Hartnett <trishah136@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added functionality to DocumentBuffer saveAs() method, so that the fileanme
	  of the file in the buffer (e.g. Untitled-1), is the filename which appears in 
	  the filename text field in the JFileChooser.
	* Added variable confirmClose into method signature of DocumentBuffer close() 
	  method. This variable is a flag. If it's set to true then the Dialog box 
	  "Untitled -1 unsaved! Save it now?" does appear, else the code sirectly skips 
	  to the DocumentBuffer save method. This was done because if a user clicks 
	  "Save Selected" on the DirtyFilesDialog then there is no need to pop up another
	  Dialog box saying "Untitled -1 unsaved! Save it now?", the user should instead 
	  be immeadiately shown the JFileChooser.
	* Changed method close in TabbedView. Previously this method called JSXE's 
	  closeDocumentBuffer() method. This caused a series of Save Dialog boxes 
	  (one for each unsaved edited file) to be produced. To get all the unsaved edited 
	  files to be displayed in one dialog box, the TabbedView close method was edited 
	  so that it creates an ArrayList of dirtyBuffers and these are sent as an argument 
	  to the DirtyFilesDialog constructor.
	* Further changed close method in TabbedView. Previously TabbedView.close() returned 
	  true to the JSXE exit method. This allowed the exit() method in JSXE to continue. 
	  I've changed TabbedView.close() so that it checks to see did the user select the 
	  Cancel button in DirtyFilesDialog. If the user did (cancelFlag = true), the close() 
	  method returns false to JSXE exit() method, causing the sequence of events required
	  for the editor to close down to stop.
	* Edited closeDocumentBuffer() method in JSXE. I wanted to be able to pass a boolean 
	  into the DocumentBuffer.close() method which is called by JSXE. closeDocumentBuffer().
	  See second point in list of changed for todays date. To pass the boolean variabe
	  confirmClose into DocumentBuffer.close(), I had to first pass it into 
	  JSXE.closeDocumentBuffer(). Rather than disturbling a lot of other code which used the 
	  JSXE.closeDocumentBuffer() method, I overloaded this method, so that there was now 2 
	  JSXE.closeDocumentBuffer() methods. The first has the same signature as the original 
	  method. It calls the new version of the method, with confirmClose set to true. This is
	  because the majority of methods which call JSXE.closeDocumentBuffer(), want the user to 
	  be prompted to confirm whether they want to save the file before closing.
	* DirtyFilesDialog is a class which produces a JDialog box which contains information about
	  edited , unsaved files. DirtyFilesDialog provides functionality for selecting all files,
	  discarding files, and saving files. It also has a Cancel button which the user can click
	  if they don't want to exit the application.
   *  net.sourceforge.jsxe.icons was updated to include a new file metal-Warn.png. This image
      would be produced by default, if I had to choosen to build DirtyFilesDialog using a 
      JOptionPane, but I decided to use a JDialog box instead, because it was easier to code.
      So the warning symbol on the DirtyFilesDialog upperleft hand corner had to be added in 
      manually.
	
05/30/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewiS@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug that caused NullPointerExceptions to be thrown when editing
      attributes of an element node.
    * Fixed a bug that caused renaming an attribute to clear the value of the
      attribute.

05/18/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated how jsXe changes build versions into human readable versions so
      that it works even after version 1.0 is released.

05/13/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Rearranged how jsXe starts up to hopefully make it run faster.
    * Added a check for the correct Xerces version.

    * Fixed a bug that caused NullPointerExceptions when renaming Processing
      Instruction nodes.
    * Updated Messages to allow you to specify a directory to load from.
    * Updated the build script to handle the messages file.

    * Fixed a bug in CompletionInfo that caused NullPointerExceptions to be
      thrown.
    * Removed the hasSchema() method from XMLDocument because it was dumb
    * Fixed a bug in AdapterNode.getAttributeAt(); Added the
      getAttributeNameAt() method.
    * Fixed several namespace bugs in the getters and setters for attributes in
      AdapterNode

05/01/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in XMLDocument with the hasCompletionInfo method.

    * Added the EnhancedMenu class that handles wrapping of the menu for you.

04/29/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in XMLDocument that caused null pointer exceptions to be
      thrown when setting the format XML option and the validation option
      in the options at the same time.
    * Added support for adding entity reference nodes to the document.

04/28/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * getAllowedElements() in AdapterNode.java now sorts the elements
    * Updated the OptionsPanel interface to remove the redundant saveOptions()
      method
    * Added node types to AdapterNode

04/27/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added Trish to the About Dialog.
    * jsXe no longer thinks the document is not well formed if the DTD/Schema
      cannot be found. It is treated as a validation error.

04/26/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Moved entityDeclared() from AdapterNode to XMLDocument
    * Cleaned up and Documented some methods
    * AdapterNode will now let you add entity nodes if the document is not
      being validated.
    * Updated Copyright info
    * Added an Edit Tag Dialog for adding tags that are defined in a DTD/Schema

04/21/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added a getActiveView() method to the jsXe class so that you can get
      the active view for the program. This will be needed by plugins and
      various other parts of jsXe.
    * Updated some doc and cleaned up the API a bit (made jsXe and Log
      constructors private)
    * Added a getCharAt() method to the ContentManager in the XMLDocument. Will
      use later.

04/18/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated documentation.
    * Removed a number of methods from MiscUtilities that were not needed or
      were jEdit specific.
    * Added a method to the AdapterNode class to allow you to get the document
      that owns it.
    * Added a method to XMLDocument to let you know if it has completion info
      aquired from a DTD/Schema

04/17/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * AdapterNodes can now report what nodes can be added to them as children
      based on a DTD or schema.

04/15/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Did some spring cleaning. Updated documentation in many classes. Updated
      headers to correctly display copyrights and javadoc to correctly contain
      authors.

04/14/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added inactive code for storing completion info that is
      retrieved from a DTD or Schema.
    * XMLDocument now creates CompletionInfo objects to describe document
      structures but jsXe doesn't use it yet.

03/30/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Released 0.3 beta
    * Added some more javadoc to XMLDocument
    * Added some calls to syncContentWithDOM in XMLDocument
    * Added validation option

03/29/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated AdapterNode to make some methods private that were accidentally
      marked public

03/23/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Users can no longer remove namespace declarations when there are
      attributes that use it.

03/17/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Altered AdapterNode to support namespaces better. It handles adding and
      removing namespace declarations much better.

03/16/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug with the debug option in logging
    * Added a command line option to enable printing debug to the command line.
    * Fixed a bug in setModel() in XMLDocument

03/13/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated the getAdapterNode() method in XMLDocument to check if the
      document is parsed and if not then attempt to go to parsed mode instead of
      simply returning null when in non-parsed mode.

03/09/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Released jsXe 0.3 pre15

03/08/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added dependency checking for plugins.
    * Added plugin error dialog

03/04/2005  version 0.3 pre15   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added better error checking when loading plugins.
    * Updated the plugin manager to look nicer. Needs a bit more work though.

03/03/2005  version 0.3 pre14   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added some changes for dependency tracking of plugins.

03/02/2005  version 0.3 pre13   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added logging functionality.

03/01/2005  version 0.3 pre12   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Small additions to XMLDocument to prepare for DTD support.
      Nothing to speak of.

02/16/2005  version 0.3 pre11   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * jsXe now loads plugins from both ~/.jsxe/jars and the install
      directory.
    * Added the soft tabs property to the document options.

01/18/2005  version 0.3 pre10   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added some new functionality for action plugins to add menu items
      to the tools menu.
    * Added a method to XMLDocument that allows you to get a copy of the
      underlying Document object.

01/08/2005  version 0.3 pre9    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Finished the plugin manager dialog.

01/06/2005  version 0.3 pre8    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added the beginnings of a plugin manager dialog.

01/05/2005  version 0.3 pre7    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Tweaked the plugin interface to eliminate some redundant methods.

12/10/2004  version 0.3 pre6    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for ActionPlugins

12/07/2004  version 0.3 pre4    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added view plugin support. Branched off the views into their own
      source trees.
    * Updated the Tree view to be a plugin

11/30/2004  version 0.3 pre3    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added some more code for the SchemaView. jsXe will require JGraph for a
      bit, until views become plugins and are moved into their own jars.
    * Added some code for loading plugins
    * Added new interfaces for the plugin API. The plugin API will have
      ViewPlugins and ActionPlugins. ActionPlugins are plugins that add actions
      to jsXe, ViewPlugins are plugins consisting of a view in the editor and
      are themselves ActionPlugins.
      
11/24/2004  version 0.3 pre2    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed how the tree editor and renderers work so that the AdapterNode
      doesn't have tree specific code in it.
    * Fixed bug in the find and replace dialog that caused a null pointer
      exception.
    * Added an 'Ignore Case' Check box to the find dialog

11/23/2004  version 0.3 pre1    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Obsoleted the DefaultViewTreeNode class.

11/22/2004  version 0.2 beta    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Redid how the view human readable names are retrieved.
    * Added preliminary support for the schema view (not enabled).

10/8/2004   version 0.2 pre25   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug that didn't update the tab width for the source view when
      you changed it in the options
    * Fixed bugs where the menu bar wasn't updated properly when closing files
      and changing views

10/2/2004   version 0.2 pre24   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for properties to remember the size and layout of the
      new options panel
    * Fixed the reload fuctionality so that it truely reloads the file and
      doesn't write the whole thing to a string object.
    * Fixed a bug that kept files open too long by not closing the Reader
      object used to read them.

9/24/2004   version 0.2 pre23   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the layout of the options dialog by taking some jEdit code.
      Should be more flexable for adding different options categories etc. Not
      to mention that it would look better.

9/21/2004   version 0.2 pre22   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Documents opened directly into the source view are no longer formatted
      automatically when the format-pretty-print property is true. This
      prevents loading documents where whitespace matters without marking
      them dirty.
    * Views now remove listeners that they add to the DocumentBuffer
    * Fixed bug that caused the document not to me marked dirty when it was
      changed.

8/25/2004   version 0.2 pre21   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * The serializer now ignores the element-content-whitespace parameter since
      the parameter only makes sense when the document is validated by DTD or
      Schema that specifies that an element MUST have only child elements
      (element-content). Also if the DOM validates this info when being edited
      then the serializer could never write out whitespace in element content
      without invalidating the document. See
      http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/javadocs/dom3-api/index.html Section 2.10
    * Removed the whitespace in element content checkbox from the options since
      it's ignored
    * Removed the show whitespace only nodes check box since showing
      whitespace only nodes in conjunction with formatting options makes
      synchronization between options and the document difficult.
    * Made the DocumentBuffer class extend XMLDocument so that there is one
      class that deals with the document as a data model.

8/19/2004   version 0.2 pre20   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug where the file is kept open by a reader or something too long.
      This didn't allow other editors to open the document until jsXe is
      closed or the objects are garbage collected.

8/18/2004   version 0.2 pre19   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug with reloading a document in the source view.
    * Fixed a bug that caused a document to be loaded dirty because the fact
      that it was dirty was saved to the recent files list
    * Added ability to create and edit processing instruction nodes

8/12/2004   version 0.2 pre18   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * The OptionsPanel now extends the EnhancedDialog class. This makes it so
      the Options dialog responds to the escape and enter keys.
    * Fixed bug where when documents are opened but not viewed the split pane
      locations in the default view are set to zero so when you open it the
      next time the panes are messed up
    * Added logic to start editing in the tree if the user starts typing while
      one of the nodes is selected. It moves focus to the right hand pane
      if necessary. It does, however, lose the first key when you start typing.
    * The Move No Drop cursor is now displayed when dragging a node over a
      drop target that rejects it.
    * The SourceView search and replace dialog now closes if you change views.
      The sourceview also reuses the dialog if it's open already when you hit
      the find menu item.

8/11/2004   version 0.2 pre17   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added back the replace field on the find and replace dialog in the
      source view but this time it works!
    * The source view now selects the text correctly in Linux when you do a
      find without first setting focus to the text area.
    * Removed the Find Next menu item since it doesn't work yet.
    * Lengthened the max length of text displayed in the tree for a text node.

08/10/2004  version 0.2 pre16   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Removed code in the TabbedView that assumed that the DocumentView was
      the same reference as the document view component.
    * Made the search dialog get the parent frame so it works better now.
    * Removed the replace field since it doesn't work.

07/30/2004  version 0.2 pre15   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added replace field to the search dialog.

07/27/2004  version 0.2 pre14   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added a very preliminary search and replace dialog to the source view.
      jsXe now requires the gnu.regexp package

07/26/2004  version 0.2 pre13   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Implemented actions by putting them in ActionSets and having them be
      registered with the jsXe application. This will allow implementation of
      a feature to allow users to set key mnemonics (shortcuts) to actions
      easier.
    * Fixed a bug that caused jsXe to not allow you to open documents that
      were not well formed.
    * Implemented the soft-tabs feature in the source view.

07/24/2004  version 0.2 pre12   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * The recent files menu now will form multiple consecutive menus if there
      are a lot of recent files in the list.

07/23/2004  version 0.2 pre11   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for a recent files list that can allow users to open
      files they have recently used.
    * Added an option to allow the user to specify the number of recent files
      that jsXe remembers
    * When jsXe opens a file now it checks if it's in the recent files list
      and opens it with the remembered properties automatically

06/23/2004  version 0.2 pre10   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed problem where the node did not appear to be selected after drag and
      drop but was. Needed to add the node to the selection model.
    * Removed references to the TabbedView from the DocumentViewFactory

06/22/2004  version 0.2 pre9    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused the right hand text pane to clear when trying to
      edit using it. When dragging and dropping a node the node stays selected
      but is not highlighted however. This may be confusing to users.

06/18/2004  version 0.2 pre8    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made some changes to make the DefaultView less dependent on jsXe classes

06/12/2004  version 0.2 pre7    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Removed references to the TabbedView and most jsXe application references.
    * Fixed a bug that causing jsXe to not update the title properly when a
      document was closed.

06/08/2004  version 0.2 pre6    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused a null pointer exception when reloading an
      untitled document.
    * Changed the DocumentView interface to return a Component via a
      method call instead of having it extend JPanel
    * Fixed a bug that caused ArrayOutOfBounds exceptions to be thrown
      sometimes when adding nodes via the JTree in DefaultView

05/30/2004  version 0.2 pre5    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Removed references to the DocumentBuffer class in the DocumentView 
      classes.

05/26/2004  version 0.2 pre4    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Removed redundant call to fireNameChanged() in DocumentBuffer
    * Moved code for setting the divider location of the split panes to an
      overridden version of setVisible(). This allows the DefaultView to set
      the divider locations after the parent container is made visible.

05/23/2004  version 0.2 pre4    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Allowed users to add a comment node to the document root.
    * fixed a bug that caused a processing instruction to not be printed on a
      new line when serialized.

05/23/2004  version 0.2 pre3    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added a new Reload action to the file menu so that users can reload the
      current document from disk

05/22/2004  version 0.2 pre2    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused non-dirty, non-untitled document to save when
      they were closed.
    * Added code for autoscrolling when doing drag and drop using the Autoscroll
      interface and fuctionality.
    * Added logic to expand tree nodes when you hover over them for a period of
      time.
    * Tooltip for processing instructions is now correct.
    * Changed the text for some nodes in the tree.
    * Changed versioning yet again so that we go 0.1.xx for build versions to
      0.1 beta since 1 should be the first minor version we have a beta for.
      Now 0.2 pre1 is the first development version preceding 0.2 beta, or
      second minor release.

05/18/2004  version 0.2 pre1    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Moved logic for the file chooser dialogs to a new jsxeFileDialog class

05/17/2004  version 0.1 beta    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Code fixed for version 0.1 beta
    * changed version naming scheme. Development versions are now the next
      major.minor version with a preXX at the end (eg. 0.2 pre75). Mostly done
      so it's easier to put the version in the build file and have it make
      sense for beta/stable releases.

05/16/2004  version 0.1.75  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed many bugs in the DefaultViewTreeModel, DefaultViewTree,
      DefaultViewTreeNode, and AdapterNode
    * Added code to remember the expanded states of nodes after they are
      dragged and dropped into other nodes

05/15/2004  version 0.1.74  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added xsd files to the file filters when opening a document.

05/14/2004  version 0.1.73  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated the DOMSerializer to implement the newest version
      of the LSSerializer interface. jsXe requires Xerces 2.6.2.
    * Updated how the splitpane locations are set up. The look better now and
      and set themselves to a percentage of the window size as a starting
      value.

05/13/2004  version 0.1.72  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in the displaying of nodes in the tree. The algorithm
      That desides if a node is to be displayed caused null pointer exceptions
      to be thrown.
    * Fixed various bugs. Moved logic for opening save dialogs to the
      DocumentBuffer class.
    * Fixed a bug in the inserting of nodes in the DefaultViewTreeNode class
      The setParent method wasn't setting the correct parent.

05/07/2004  version 0.1.71  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added a layer between the AdapterNode and the GUI. The DefaultViewTreeNode
      class contains properties for use with the GUI. AdapterNode now doesn't
      any GUI specific code in it.

04/23/2004  version 0.1.70  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed some syncing problems with the XMLDocument and client classes
      when the serialization process changes the structure of the document
      by splitting cdata-section nodes.
    * Fixed a bug that caused IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions to be thrown when
      writing a document over 5120 bytes.
    * Fixed a bug in the serializer that caused the root element opening tag
      to be placed directly after a document type definition.
    * updated how the DOMSerializer uses Writers. It uses them in a better way
      now.

04/23/2004  version 0.1.69  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that was causing comment nodes to indented too far
      when formatting the document during serialization.
    * Reworked the updatedMenuBar() method in the TabbedView so that
      it doesn't create the whole menubar from scratch each time it's
      updated.
    * Fixed a bug in serialization that caused only the public id and not
      the system id to be seraliazed if both existed in a doctype node.

04/22/2004  version 0.1.68  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a build problem that was introduced into cvs.
    * Fixed bug where jsxe generated NumberFormatExceptions if user defined
      saved properties were incorrectly formatted.
    * When a document is opened the document root element is now expanded
      by default.
    * When dragging and dropping and/or adding nodes the nodes that whose
      locations have changed are always visible after the change.
    * Added a Close All action to the file menu so that users can close all of
      the open xml documents at once.
    * Made it so that external dtds are not loaded since jsXe can't do anything
      with them anyway.
    * Implemented support for split-cdata-sections in the DOMSerializer

04/21/2004  version 0.1.67  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made it so that element nodes can't be edited in the JTree unless
      you select 'Rename Node' from the context menu. This is done because of
      some problems with compatiblity between the editing and drag and drop.
    * The DefaultView now uses the default options set in the
      documentview.default.props file. Any properties used by this class should
      have default values set in this properties file.

04/20/2004  version 0.1.66  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made split panes in the default tree view one touch expandable.
    * Made it so if opening a file and the only document open is untitled
      and clean then jsXe closes it.

04/18/2004  version 0.1.65  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Cleaned up some code in the TabbedView class. Removed the public update()
      method.
    * Changed some actions in the DefaultViewTree extend AbstractAction since
      they will probobly have key mnemonics in the future.
    * Added key mnemonics to the menu bar items so that you can navigate them
      easier using the keyboard.

04/17/2004  version 0.1.64  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added logic to the tree in the Default view so that dragged and dropped
      nodes are always visible after a drop. New nodes that are added
      through the context menu are also visible after they are added.
    * Fixed support for cdata-sections in the DOMSerializer

04/16/2004  version 0.1.63  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added logic to highlight a node when the user is going to drop onto a
      particular node.

04/04/2004  version 0.1.62  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed the problem where dragging an element node that was already
      selected initiated editing for that node. That was kind of silly so
      it doesn't do it any more.
    * Fixed a problem in the serialization where characters weren't resolved
      to entities in attributes

04/03/2004  version 0.1.61  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a couple bugs that caused null pointer exceptions when inserting
      around the document root.
    * Fixed it so that when you drag off the tree the cue line is erased.

04/02/2004  version 0.1.60  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added much better drag and drop support. You can now rearrange nodes
      with ease. The relative location of the drop is used to determine
      where to put the dragged node. Draws a line in between nodes in the
      JTree when nodes will be inserted before or after a node.

04/01/2004  version 0.1.59  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added an addAdaterNodeAt() method to the AdapterNode class so that
      it would be possible to add better drag and drop functionality, Notably
      being able to rearrange nodes within an element.
    * Added some more fold marks and javadoc to several classes.
    * Added the ability to rearrange text nodes and other nodes that aren't
      elements around within an element.
    * Added support for checking the version and getting command-line help
      for jsXe via command-line options
    * Fixed a bug that didn't allow users to open a document if the DTD couldn't
      be found. Still won't think it's well formed though.

03/31/2004  version 0.1.58  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * When you save out of the options panel after you changed options that
      change the XML document itself the open document is marked as dirty.
    * Fixed a bug where the source was not being changed when the encoding
      was changed because the XMLDocument object thought that the source
      was synced with the DOM.

03/18/2004  version 0.1.57  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added check so that dragging and dropping a node on it's parent doesn't
      do anything and the buffer is not marked dirty (since nothing really
      changed).

02/29/2004  version 0.1.56  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added preliminary drag n drop support for the tree in the default view.
      You can now drag nodes from one parent to another in the tree view. You
      can also drag a node to any thing that accepts text from a drag n drop
      operation.

02/27/2004  version 0.1.55  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Refactored the tree in the DefaultView to it's own class.
    * Added in some preliminary drag n drop stuff. Commented out
      so it will compile

02/21/2004  version 0.1.54  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * DOCTYPE nodes are no longer visible in the tree. Some other method for
      editing doc types will have to be added to jsXe later.

02/16/2004  version 0.1.53  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug introduced in 0.1.51 that caused formatting not to work in
      the source view and when saving.

02/08/2004  version 0.1.52  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for writing the internal part of a DOCTYPE to the XML
      document.

02/07/2004  version 0.1.51  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Cleaned up the DOMSerializer and DOMSerializerConfiguration classes
    * Added a flag to the DefaultXMLDocument class to tell if the DOM is synced
      with the text content in parsed mode. Now it won't sync and thus serialize
      the DOM to the content every time text is requested.

01/23/2004  version 0.1.50  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for soft tabs in the DOMSerializer
    * Fixed a bug with how AdapterNode keeps references to it's children.
    * Added support for discarding default attributes in the DOMSerializer.

12/21/2003  version 0.1.49  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed the icon that is rendered for a tree node when editing. Got some
      weird behaviour out of the JTree when using the previous CellRenderer. I
      created a new one that simply renders Element node icons since they are
      the only editable nodes in the JTree.
    * Updated the DOMSerializerConfiguration class to support all the DOM3 LS
      parameters (even if the DOMSerializer itself doesn't yet).

12/20/2003  version 0.1.48  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Merged some of Bilel's changes to AdapterNode making it better able to
      handle more XML node types.
    * Nodes in the default view tree are now rendered as different icons for
      different node types. (Note: used icons from XML plugin for jEdit)

12/19/2003  version 0.1.47  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a minor bug in the logic to update tab titles.
    * jsXe now asks you if you really want to overwrite existing files on disk.

12/18/2003  version 0.1.46  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed tabs to use icons instead of appending a '*' to the tab name to
      indicate a file is dirty.
    * Added javadoc to the AdapterNode class.
    * Changed the security mode for the getNode() and setParentNode() methods
      in AdapterNode from protected to default. All other classes should use
      the public interface.

12/16/2003  version 0.1.45  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in the attributes table where it wasn't updated properly.
      It now updates properly and sorts based on the order in which they will
      be serialized (alphabetical).
    * Updated many of the interfaces to make them more OO like. Before,
      DefaultView and TabbedView could be created but would have wierd default
      values and relied on the user to initialize them with a document. Now an
      initial document is required to construct them. This should be better for
      reuse.
    * Added a "Rename Node" action to the default view tree's context menu. You
      can still rename it by clicking twice (not double clicking) on the element
      node.

12/14/2003  version 0.1.44  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated the DOMSerializer and related classes to be compliant with the
      latest version of the DOM3. So now jsXe requires Xerces 2.6.0.
    * Fixed a bug where the html pane was editable after opening a new document
      though no node was selected.

11/19/2003  version 0.1.43  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in the CustomFileFilter class that caused it to go into
      an infinite loop with files with no extension.
    * When opening an XML document jsXe now cycles through installed views
      until it finds one that will open a document. This allows opening
      documents that are not well formed in the source view.
    * Added support for opening multiple files at a time. Fixed a few bugs
      in that process.
    * Fixed an EntityResolver bug that was introduced with the DocumentBuffer
      class.

11/15/2003  version 0.1.42  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the XMLDocument and DefaultXMLDocument classes to handle insertion
      and removal of raw text.
    * DefaultXMLDocument now stores text in a ContextManager object much like
      the way jEdit stores text. This should be more efficient and more scalable
      to large files than storing the raw text in String object.
    * Created a DocumentBuffer class to handle editor/application specific
      things like the underlying file on disk, the name of the buffer, whether
      it's dirty or not etc...
    * Documents can now be serialized/written to disk even if they are not
      well-formed (However, they still can't be opened).

11/11/2003  version 0.1.41  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed problem where the tree in the default view allowed you to select
      multiple nodes and cause undesired operation.

11/10/2003  version 0.1.40  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug where the * dirty file indicator was going away when switching
      views.
    * Fixed a bug where a document was marked dirty when switching views.

10/30/2003  version 0.1.39  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for dirty files. When you make changes to a document
      it is marked dirty and has an '*' in the tab name. jsXe also asks you
      if you want to save if you have dirty documents open.
    * Fixed many miscellaneous bugs.
    * AdapterNodes notify the XMLDocument parent when changes are made to the
      DOM.

10/23/2003  version 0.1.38  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused an error message and undesired behavior when
      removing nodes.

10/23/2003  version 0.1.37  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed the problem where the parser couldn't resolve the location
      of an external entity. Made it so that the parser searched for
      the entity relative to the document's path and not the path
      where you started jsXe.
    * Changed to new versioning system so that build versions and
      major and minor version builds update jsXe's version automatically in
      the build.properties.
    * Changed SourceViewDocument to not update the XMLDocument's model each
      time you insert text but set the text only after all editing is complete.
      This improves performance but does not update the encoding when you change
      it in the properties. Since I am going to change it so that you can't edit
      the header in source view anyway, this isn't as much of an issue.

10/20/2003  version 0.1.17  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added the ability to register listeners with the AdapterNode and
      XMLDocument interfaces.
    * Updated GUI classes to register listeners with the XMLDocuments and
      update themselves when properties change.

10/08/2003  version 0.1.16  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made AdapterNodes persistent. Now the JTree functions like it
      should when updateUI is called on it.

09/07/2003  version 0.1.15  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added functionality to the XMLDocument interface for adding listeners
      so objects can be notified when the XML document changes.
      Added an interface XMLDocumentListener. Documented it with javadoc.
    * Fixed a bug that caused problems when saving as a file that was already
      open. This was fixed earlier but the bug was reintroduced somewhere.

9/01/2003   version 0.1.14  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the XMLDocument validate() method to be checkWellFormedness().
      Changed the implementation of isValidated() to be named isWellFormed() and
      isWellFormed() now calls checkWellFormedNess to find out out whether it is
      well-formed or not.

8/31/2003   version 0.1.13  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug with createElement() creating elements with a null local name
      when element nodes are renamed. Used createElementNS() instead.
    * Fixed performance issues with opening files (that weren't even that
      large.)

8/30/2003   version 0.1.12  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a very bad bug where jsXe was not writing anything to files when
      saving because the OutputStreamWriter was not flushed.

8/30/2003   version 0.1.11  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added an indent width option to the options dialog. Currently only used
      when formatting a document while serializing and as the tab width in the
      source view.

8/29/2003   version 0.1.10  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed indentation when serializing a document.
    * Changed the layout of the options dialog. It looks a little better now.

8/28/2003   version 0.1.9  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the DOMSerializer class to conform to the DOM3 standard
      DOMWriter (old) interface. Used the java.io.OutputStreamWriter class for
      encoding. Added an encoding option to the option dialog.
