    * Fixed bug 1433905. I implemented end of line markers when I didn't need
      to. And I implemented them wrong, introducing this bug.

    * Fixed bug 1433918. The JEditTextArea now creates a new set of defaults
      for each instance of JEditTextArea. Each new text area was using the same
      InputHandler instance so the key bindings for each text area were being
      overridden.

    * Added end of line markers and and option to turn them on or off.

    * Implemented maintaining indent when adding new lines and soft tabs
      by adding key bindings to the input handler rather than overriding
      processKeyEvent or whatever
