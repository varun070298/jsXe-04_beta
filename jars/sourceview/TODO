* Version 0.3 beta (Plugin Support)
    
* Version 0.4 beta (Actions)
    
    * Implement undo
    
    * Look at HistoryTextField and HistoryModel in jEdit. Use code from there
      to implement a history text model for combo boxes in jsXe. Make use of
      this in the find dialog and other dialogs.
    
* Version 0.5 beta (DTD support and Threading)
    
    * Add a feature that allows you to validate the document and moves the
      cursor to the location of a parse/validation error in the source view.
    
* Version 0.6 beta (GUI focus)
    
    * Enhance the source view with element completion and other cool stuff. See
      the XML plugin for jEdit for ideas. How would I display well-formedness
      errors?
        * Element completion
        * Highlighting where a parse error is located. Is it feasable to do
          multiple parses to find as many errors as possible? SAX parsers find
          the first one and then quit.
    
    * Implement syntax highlighting.
