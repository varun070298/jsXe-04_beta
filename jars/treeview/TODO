TODO:

* Version 0.4 beta (Actions)
    
    * Add a "trim whitespace in text nodes" option.
    
    * Implement cut, copy, paste
    
    * Fully implement gui actions to include key mnemonics etc. so the actions
      act like you would expect. Allow users to define keys shortcuts to
      actions.
    
    * By this time, make sure all classes are documented with javadoc.
    
    * Make sure all instance variables are prefixed with m_ and are named in a
      consistent manner.
      
* Version 0.5 beta (DTD support and Threading)
    
    * Add support for DTDs and Schema and add feedback about whether the
      current document can be validated by the DTD and what needs to be done to
      the document before it will comply with the DTD. Create interfaces to
      coincide with the XMLDocument interfaces that handles various Schema.
        * Look at some projects that convert DTD to Schema. This may be useful
          so that DTDs can be edited as Schema. Is that possible? DTDs seem to
          have features that aren't in Schema and don't translate at all.
        * Look at the XML plugin for jEdit for ways of finding what nodes can
          be inserted at various locations in the document.
    
* Version 0.6 beta (GUI focus)
    
    * Add a ghosted image of the node to drag and drop cursor. Hopefully the
      whole cursor can be replaced with the image since the default drag
      cursor is dumb in linux.
    
* Version 0.7 beta
    
    * Build into the interfaces support for printing. Implement printing
      support in the Default View and SourceView
    
    * Look for ways to improve efficiency with large XML documents
    
    * Add support for dependency tracking of plugins. Some plugins may be
      dependent on others and so this may affect the order that they are
      loaded and error checking.
    
* Version 0.8 beta

    * Bug fixes?

* Version 0.9 beta

    * Bug fixes?

* Version 1.0

    * Bug fixes?
